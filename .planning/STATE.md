# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-11)

**Core value:** An independent creator can go from a raw story idea to a coherent final video in one guided, resumable workflow.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — langgraph-orchestration-durable-execution

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **LangGraph as primary orchestration**: User explicitly chose full LangGraph migration for v1. FastAPI remains application shell; LangGraph owns orchestration, persistence, interrupt/resume, and graph state.
- **v1 trimmed to core loop**: v1.x items (cost estimation, timeline view, provider fallback, agent activity logs) deferred to keep delivery focused.
- **Solo-creator focus**: v1 optimized for independent creators, not multi-user team collaboration.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **FastAPI version upgrade**: Current repo uses ≥0.115, target is ≥0.128. Must verify Pydantic v2 compatibility before Phase 1 implementation.
- **tldraw version**: Repo references ^4.3 but latest confirmed is v4.2.0 — version resolution needs verification.
- **LangGraph migration**: Existing repo uses Claude Agent SDK for orchestration. Phase 2 requires migrating all agent workflows to LangGraph StateGraph with persistence and interrupts.
